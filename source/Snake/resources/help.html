    <h3 id="TheGame">The Game</h3>
    <p>The game of snake is very simple. You control the snake, and your aim is to collect as much fruit as possible. When you eat fruit, the snake is extended and you score points.</p>
    <p>Simple right? But don&#39;t be fooled.</p>
    <p>This modern version of snake, Snake Attack, by Stuart Garner, has many twists to make it harder to score and win. Your aim is still to collect fruit, however, don&#39;t let the blue, &#39;CPU&#39;, snake get them first. He will try to get all of the fruit, robbing you of valuable time. You only have two minutes to score as many points as possible, 10 for each piece of fruit. Only one piece of fruit appears at any given time, so you must race him to get that piece first. If you hit him or yourself, your snake will reset, your score will reset and you&#39;ll have to start from scratch. But don&#39;t worry, you can cut him off and he will reset, making it easier for you to get that piece of fruit. He&#39;ll also reset if he is silly enough to hit himself.</p>
    
    <h3 id="Controls">Controls</h3>
    <p>To control your snake, use the Left, Right, Up and Down arrow keys to move your snake accordingly (NB: You can&#39;t move back onto your snake, only left and right from the direction you&#39;re facing). To show the Game Menu, press P or Esc.</p>
    
    <h3 id="GameMenu">Game Menu</h3>
    <p>The Game Menu, which is shown at the start and when the game is over, is also accessable during a game by pressing P or Esc. It contains seven options:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Resume Game</b>: Resumes the currently paused game</li>
        <li><b>New Game</b>: Starts a new game</li>
        <li><b>High Scores</b>: Shows the High Scores window, which contains all of the saved, local scores</li>
        <li><b>Options</b>: Shows the Options window; see <a href="#Options">Options</a> below</li>
        <li><b>Help</b>: Shows the Help window</li>
        <li><b>About</b>: Shows the About window, which contains version, copyright and developer details</li>
        <li><b>Exit</b>: Exits the game</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="Options">Options</h3>
    <p>Options, accesable via the Game Menu, contains three sections:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Tips</b></li>
        <li><b>High Scores</b></li>
        <li><b>Game</b></li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the Tips section, there is a check box which says "Show tips and cycle...", by checking this, tips will be dispayed in the bottom right hand corner of the game and will cycle between randomly selected tips. The cycle time can be changed in the drop down box where it says "...and cycle every {drop down box} seconds." The other two sections can be used to reset the high scores and to reset the entire game (this option also resets the high scores).</p>
